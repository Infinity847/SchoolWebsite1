            <h2><i>This is NOT a real school website</i></h2>
    <p> I make this website just to practice my html skills ;) Things you should know is that I dont use bootstrap and I like to use not too much CSS 3.<br> There is an actual website for my school.<br> But its kind of bad so I decide to make my own. The website that my school made is terrible or how I like to say it is that school website = bad.</p>
